                    Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor Konrad Adenauer. The
                    first
                    German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and Bonn. Today, this is the
                    Bundesautobahn 555. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a
                    motorway
                    ring
                    road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (Stadtautobahn) was planned, but only partially
                    put
                    into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became Bundesstraße
                    ("Federal
                    Road") B 55a, which begins at the Zoobrücke ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with A 4 and A 3 at the
                    interchange
                    Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as Stadtautobahn by most locals. In contrast to this,
                    the
                    Nord-Süd-Fahrt ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre
                    through-route,
                    which had already been anticipated by planners such as Fritz Schumacher in the 1920s. The last
                    section
                    south
                    of Ebertplatz was completed in 1972. In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in North
                    Rhine-Westphalia was opened to traffic on Bundesautobahn 3, part of the eastern section of the
                    Cologne
                    Beltway between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.

                    Cycling is particularly popular when the weather is fine. Apart from Roman and medieval monuments,
                    parks, Stadtwald forest and Grüngürtel green belt, beer gardens and other watering holes, you can

                    Cologne with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day).
                    There
                    are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main and Berlin. ICE Trains

                    The Cologne Stadtbahn operated by Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB)[79] is an extensive light rail
                    system
                    that
                    is partially underground and serves Cologne and a number of neighbouring cities. It evolved from the
                    tram
                    system. Nearby Bonn is linked by both the Stadtbahn and main line railway trains, and occasional
                    recreational boats on the Rhine. Düsseldorf is also linked by S-Bahn trains, which are operated by
                    Deutsche
                    Bahn.

                    The Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn has 5 lines which cross Cologne.The S13/S19 runs 24/7 between Cologne Hbf and
                    Cologne/Bonn airport.

                    There are also frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and Eurolines

                    to
